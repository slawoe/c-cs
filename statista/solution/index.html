            <h3>About the challenge</h3>
            <p>
              At statista, the quality of each applicant for the development
              team is tested through a coding challenge. An example of what this
              challenge can look like can be seen here in the form of the
              fizzbuzz list. Every number up to 100 that is divisible by 3, by 5
              or by both numbers should be automatically replaced by a
              predefined word and highlighted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Are you as curious as I am to see whether the applicant here has
              managed this? Let's take a look inside the box.
