# Exercise for Web Developers #

Welcome to our programming exercise for Web Developers. This exercise is split in two parts:

1. Checking the provided templates for design and programming errors and improve the overall quality
2. Display a FizzBuzz list

For more details, please see below. We donâ€™t expect you to spend more than two hours on these tasks.

---

## Part 1 ##

It seems that some errors have creeped into the provided files.
Please find and correct them and improve the overall code quality.

#### Notes ####

The errors range from small to absolute no-gos. When correcting the files, check for the following things:

* Has valid HTML(5)/CSS(3)/JavaScript been used?
* Are there any typos in file names, class names, functions, etc.? (You do not have to check the copy text. Itâ€™s correct, we promise. ðŸ˜‰)
* Is the design in line with the corporate design of Statista? (Use [Statista.com](https://www.statista.com/) as a reference.)
* Is the template fully responsive?
* Does the template violate against major accessibility guidelines?

---

## Part 2 ##

Choose a way to display the numbers 1 to 100 in an unsorted HTML list. Also change all multiples of three to ***Fizz*** instead of the number and all multiples of five to ***Buzz***. All numbers which are multiples of both three and five should be changed to ***FizzBuzz***.
Use the templates proved in this repository to display the list.
Design the list in a clean but sophisticated way that fits the look and feel of [Statista.com](https://www.statista.com/). Highlight the ***Fizz***, ***Buzz*** and ***FizzBuzz*** entries each in a unique way.

#### Notes ####

* If you want to you can use a JavaScript framework
* Use [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) to name your CSS classes
* The usage of jQuery is forbidden
